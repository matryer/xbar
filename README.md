## Get started

[Get the latest version of BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases). Copy it to your Applications folder and run it - it will ask you to (create and) select a plugins folder, do so.

Homebrew Cask users can, alternatively, install BitBar by running `brew cask install bitbar`.

Note: Make sure you have updated your Homebrew Cask. Run `brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update` as mentioned in [Homebrew-Cask README](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/6c1af93c7f02778f77e5800b8914c0a1595a62e0/README.md)

[Browse our plugins](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins) to find useful scripts, or [write your own](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#writing-plugins).

### It's free, so please donate

If you love this, any BitCoin donations are most welcome, to `1DGoNEYAnjE5DqK7y5zMPR4PLU5HLKpLNR` or [send something useful (Amazon Wishlist)](http://amzn.to/1Pd9yOt).

## Installing plugins

Just download the plugin of your choice into your BitBar plugins directory and choose `Refresh` from one of the BitBar menus.

### Configure the refresh time

The refresh time is in the filename of the plugin, following this format:

    {name}.{time}.{ext}

  * `name` - The name of the file
  * `time` - The refresh rate (see below)
  * `ext` - The file extension

For example:

  * `date.1m.sh` would refresh every minute.

Most plugins will come with a default, but you can change it to anything you like:

  * 10s - ten seconds
  * 1m - one minute
  * 2h - two hours
  * 1d - a day

### Ensure you have execution rights

Ensure the plugin is executable by running `chmod +x plugin.sh`.

### Using symlinks

Because Git will ignore everything in `Plugins/Enabled`, you can use it to maintain your own plugins directory while still benefitting from tracking (upstream) changes.

#### Example

	cd Plugins/Enabled

	# Enable spotify plugin
	ln -s ../Music/spotify.10s.sh

	# Enable uptime plugin and change update interval to 30 seconds
	ln -s ../System/uptime.1m.sh uptime.30s.sh

Then select the `Enabled` folder in your BitBar preferences.

#### Resetting Plugin Directory

In case you made the mistake of choosing a directory with thousands of files as the plugin directory and BitBar getting stuck forever, do this from terminal to reset it:

`defaults delete com.matryer.BitBar`

# Writing plugins

We're always looking for new plugins, so please send us pull requests if you write anything cool or useful.

### Got ideas?

If you've got ideas, or want to report a bug, nip over to our [issues page](=https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/issues) and let us know.

If you want to contribute, please send us a pull request and we'll add it to our repos.

  * Ensure the plugin is executable
  * Be sure to include [appropriate Metadata](#metadata) to enhance the plugin's entry on getbitbar.com

## Plugin API

  * To write a plugin, just write some form of executable script that outputs to the standard output.
  * Multiple lines will be cycled through over and over.
  * If your output contains a line consisting only of `---`, the lines below it will appear in the dropdown for that plugin, but won't appear in the menu bar itself.
  * Your lines might contain `|` to separate the title from other parameters, such as...
    * `href=..` to make the dropdown items clickable
    * `color=..` to change their text color. eg. `color=red` or `color=#ff0000`
    * `font=..` to change their text font. eg. `font=UbuntuMono-Bold`
    * `size=..` to change their text size. eg. `size=12`
    * `bash=..` to make the dropdown run a given script terminal with your script e.g. 		  `bash=/Users/user/BitBar_Plugins/scripts/nginx.restart.sh` if there are spaces in the file path you will need quotes. e.g
    * `bash="/Users/user/BitBar Plugins/scripts/nginx.restart.sh"`
    * `param1=` to specify arguments to the script. additional params like this `param2=foo param3=bar` full example  `bash="/Users/user/BitBar_Plugins/scripts/nginx.restart.sh" param1=--verbose` assuming that nginx.restart.sh is executable.
    * or `bash=/usr/bin/ruby param1=/Users/user/rubyscript.rb param2=arg1 param3=arg2` if script is not executable
    * `terminal=..` start bash script without opening Terminal. `true` or `false`
    * `refresh=..` to make the dropdown items refresh the plugin it belongs to
    * `dropdown=..` May be set to `true` or `false`. If `false`, the line will only appear and cycle in the status bar but not in the dropdown
    * `length=..` to truncate the line to the specified number of characters. A `â€¦` will be added to any truncated strings, as well as a tooltip displaying the full string. eg. `length=10`
    * `trim=..` whether to trim leading/trailing whitespace from the title.  `true` or `false` (defaults to `true`)
    * `alternate=true` to mark a line as an alternate to the previous one for when the Option key is pressed in the dropdown

### Metadata

To enhance your entry on [getbitbar.com](https://getbitbar.com/), add the following metadata to your source code (usually in comments somewhere):

```
# <bitbar.title>Title goes here</bitbar.title>
# <bitbar.version>v1.0</bitbar.version>
# <bitbar.author>Your Name</bitbar.author>
# <bitbar.author.github>your-github-username</bitbar.author.github>
# <bitbar.desc>Short description of what your plugin does.</bitbar.desc>
# <bitbar.image>http://www.hosted-somewhere/pluginimage</bitbar.image>
# <bitbar.dependencies>python,ruby,node</bitbar.dependencies>
# <bitbar.abouturl>http://url-to-about.com/</bitbar.abouturl>
```

  * The comment characters can be anything - use what is suitable for your language
  * `bitbar.title` - The title of the plugin
  * `bitbar.version` - The version of the plugin (start with `v1.0`)
  * `bitbar.author` - Your name
  * `bitbar.author.github` - Your github username (without `@`)
  * `bitbar.desc` - A short description of what your plugin does
  * `bitbar.image` - A hosted image showing a preview of your plugin (ideally open)
  * `bitbar.dependencies` - Comma separated list of dependencies
  * `bitbar.abouturl` - Absolute URL to about information

For a real example, see the [Cycle text and detail plugin source code](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Tutorial/cycle_text_and_detail.sh).

### Useful tips

  * If you're writing scripts, ensure it has a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) at the top.
  * You can add to `PATH` by including something like `export PATH='/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH'` in your plugin script.
  * You can use emoji in the output (find an example in the Music/vox Plugin).
  * If your bash script generates text in another language, set the `LANG` variable with: `export LANG="es_ES.UTF-8"` (for Spanish) to show the text in correct format.

### Examples

#### One line plugin

    #!/bin/bash
    date

#### Multi-line plugin

    #!/bin/bash

    # the current date and time
    date

    # the current username
    echo $USER

    # the current user id
    id -u

#### Multi-line plugin with extra data

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "One"
    echo "Two"
    echo "Three"
    echo "---"
    echo "Four"
    echo "Five"
    echo "Six"

  * Only One, Two and Three will appear in the top bar
  * Clicking the plugin menu item will show all lines


#### Multi-line plugin with links and colors

    #!/bin/bash
    curl -m 1 http://example.com -I >/dev/null 2>&1
    [ $? -gt 0 ] && echo "FAIL | color=red" || echo "OK | color=green"
    echo "---"
    echo "Show Graphs | color=#123def href=http://example.com/graph?foo=bar"
    echo "Show KPI Report | color=purple href=http://example.com/report"

#### Multi-line plugin with fonts and colors

![BitBar Example showing colored fonts](https://raw.github.com/matryer/bitbar/master/Docs/BitBar-Example-Menu-Colors-Fonts.png)

    #!/bin/zsh
    FONT=( 'size=14' 'font=UbuntuMono' )
    if ((0)); then echo "DO | $FONT color=orange"
    else           echo "DO | $FONT color=cadetblue"
    echo "---"
    ...
