## Get started

[Get the latest version of BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases). Copy it to your Applications folder and run it - it will ask you to (create and) select a plugins folder, do so.

[Browse our plugins](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins) to find useful scripts, or [write your own](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar#writing-plugins).

### It's free, so please donate

If you love this, any BitCoin donations are most welcome, to `1DGoNEYAnjE5DqK7y5zMPR4PLU5HLKpLNR` or [send something useful (Amazon Wishlist)](http://amzn.to/1Pd9yOt).

## Installing plugins

Just download the plugin of your choice into your BitBar plugins directory and choose `Refresh` from one of the BitBar menus.

### Configure the refresh time

The refresh time is in the filename of the plugin, following this format:

    {name}.{time}.{ext}

  * `name` - The name of the file
  * `time` - The refresh rate (see below)
  * `ext` - The file extension

For example:

  * `date.1m.sh` would refresh every minute.

Most plugins will come with a default, but you can change it to anything you like:

  * 10s - ten seconds
  * 1m - one minute
  * 2h - two hours
  * 1d - a day

### Ensure you have execution rights

Ensure the plugin is executable by running `chmod +x plugin.sh`.

### Using symlinks

Because Git will ignore everything in `Plugins/Enabled`, you can use it to maintain your own plugins directory while still benefitting from tracking (upstream) changes.

#### Example

	cd Plugins/Enabled

	# Enable spotify plugin
	ln -s ../Music/spotify.10s.sh

	# Enable uptime plugin and change update interval to 30 seconds
	ln -s ../System/uptime.1m.sh uptime.30s.sh

Then select the `Enabled` folder in your BitBar preferences.

#### Resetting Plugin Directory

In case you made the mistake of choosing a directory with thousands of files as the plugin directory and BitBar getting stuck forever, do this from terminal to reset it:

`defaults delete com.matryer.BitBar`

  * Ensure the plugin is executable
  * Be sure to include [appropriate Metadata](#metadata) to enhance the plugin's entry on getbitbar.com

## Plugin API

  * To write a plugin, just write some form of executable script that outputs to the standard output.
  * Multiple lines will be cycled through over and over.
  * If your output contains a line consisting only of `---`, the lines below it will appear in the dropdown for that plugin, but won't appear in the menu bar itself.
  * Lines beginning with `--` will appear in submenus.
    * Use `----` etc. for nested submenus. Two dashes per level of nesting.
  * Your lines might contain `|` to separate the title from other parameters, such as...
    * `href=..` to make the item clickable
    * `color=..` to change their text color. eg. `color=red` or `color=#ff0000`
    * `font=..` to change their text font. eg. `font=UbuntuMono-Bold`
    * `size=..` to change their text size. eg. `size=12`
    * `bash=..` to make the item run a given script terminal with your script e.g. `bash=/Users/user/BitBar_Plugins/scripts/nginx.restart.sh` if there are spaces in the file path you will need quotes e.g. `bash="/Users/user/BitBar Plugins/scripts/nginx.restart.sh"`
    * `param1=` to specify arguments to the script. additional params like this `param2=foo param3=bar` full example  `bash="/Users/user/BitBar_Plugins/scripts/nginx.restart.sh" param1=--verbose` assuming that nginx.restart.sh is executable or `bash=/usr/bin/ruby param1=/Users/user/rubyscript.rb param2=arg1 param3=arg2` if script is not executable
    * `terminal=..` start bash script without opening Terminal. `true` or `false`
    * `refresh=..` to make the item refresh the plugin it belongs to. If the item runs a script, refresh is performed after the script finishes. eg. `refresh=true`
    * `dropdown=..` May be set to `true` or `false`. If `false`, the line will only appear and cycle in the status bar but not in the dropdown
    * `length=..` to truncate the line to the specified number of characters. A `…` will be added to any truncated strings, as well as a tooltip displaying the full string. eg. `length=10`
    * `trim=..` whether to trim leading/trailing whitespace from the title.  `true` or `false` (defaults to `true`)
    * `alternate=true` to mark a line as an alternate to the previous one for when the Option key is pressed in the dropdown
    * `templateImage=..` set an image for this item. The image data must be passed as base64 encoded string and should consist of only black and clear pixels. The alpha channel in the image can be used to adjust the opacity of black content, however. This is the recommended way to set an image for the statusbar. Use a 144 DPI resolution to support Retina displays. The imageformat can be any of the formats supported by Mac OS X
    * `image=..` set an image for this item. The image data must be passed as base64 encoded string. Use a 144 DPI resolution to support Retina displays. The imageformat can be any of the formats supported by Mac OS X
    * `emojize=false` will disable parsing of github style `:mushroom:` into :mushroom:
    * `ansi=false` turns off parsing of ANSI codes.

### Metadata

To enhance your entry on [getbitbar.com](https://getbitbar.com/), add the following metadata to your source code (usually in comments somewhere):

```
# <bitbar.title>Title goes here</bitbar.title>
# <bitbar.version>v1.0</bitbar.version>
# <bitbar.author>Your Name</bitbar.author>
# <bitbar.author.github>your-github-username</bitbar.author.github>
# <bitbar.desc>Short description of what your plugin does.</bitbar.desc>
# <bitbar.image>http://www.hosted-somewhere/pluginimage</bitbar.image>
# <bitbar.dependencies>python,ruby,node</bitbar.dependencies>
# <bitbar.abouturl>http://url-to-about.com/</bitbar.abouturl>
```

  * The comment characters can be anything - use what is suitable for your language
  * `bitbar.title` - The title of the plugin
  * `bitbar.version` - The version of the plugin (start with `v1.0`)
  * `bitbar.author` - Your name
  * `bitbar.author.github` - Your github username (without `@`)
  * `bitbar.desc` - A short description of what your plugin does
  * `bitbar.image` - A hosted image showing a preview of your plugin (ideally open)
  * `bitbar.dependencies` - Comma separated list of dependencies
  * `bitbar.abouturl` - Absolute URL to about information

For a real example, see the [Cycle text and detail plugin source code](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Tutorial/cycle_text_and_detail.sh).

### Useful tips

  * If you're writing scripts, ensure it has a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) at the top.
  * You can add to `PATH` by including something like `export PATH='/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH'` in your plugin script.
  * You can use emoji in the output (find an example in the Music/vox Plugin).
  * If your bash script generates text in another language, set the `LANG` variable with: `export LANG="es_ES.UTF-8"` (for Spanish) to show the text in correct format.
  * If you want to call the plugin script for action, you can use `bash=$0`
  * If your plugin should support Retina displays, export your icon at 36x36 with a resolution of 144 DPI (see [this issue](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/issues/314) for a more thorough explanation).

### Examples

#### One line plugin

    #!/bin/bash
    date

#### Multi-line plugin

    #!/bin/bash

    # the current date and time
    date

    # the current username
    echo $USER

    # the current user id
    id -u

#### Multi-line plugin with extra data

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "One"
    echo "Two"
    echo "Three"
    echo "---"
    echo "Four"
    echo "Five"
    echo "Six"

  * Only One, Two and Three will appear in the top bar
  * Clicking the plugin menu item will show all lines


#### Multi-line plugin with links and colors

    #!/bin/bash
    curl -m 1 http://example.com -I >/dev/null 2>&1
    [ $? -gt 0 ] && echo "FAIL | color=red" || echo "OK | color=green"
    echo "---"
    echo "Show Graphs | color=#123def href=http://example.com/graph?foo=bar"
    echo "Show KPI Report | color=purple href=http://example.com/report"

#### Multi-line plugin with fonts and colors

![BitBar Example showing colored fonts](https://raw.github.com/matryer/bitbar/master/Docs/BitBar-Example-Menu-Colors-Fonts.png)

    #!/bin/zsh
    FONT=( 'size=14' 'font=UbuntuMono' )
    if ((0)); then echo "DO | $FONT color=orange"
    else           echo "DO | $FONT color=cadetblue"
    echo "---"
    ...
